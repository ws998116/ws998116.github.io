I'm finally starting a personal website and I'm not quite sure why it took so long. I suppose that I've just had too many other ideas that I was more excited about. At the moment I still have lots of ideas but I'm not sure which one is worthwhile, so I'm doing this.

This moment was inspired by [this blog post](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/personal-website-vulnerability/) by Jim Nielsen.

Like Jim writes, I'm doing this to put myself out there. I'm also doing this for other reasons - to have a creative outlet (writing/design/engineering), to learn, and to grow.

Today I feel like I have some headspace, which is something I haven't felt in a while. It's a good feeling, and I've been working towards that for a while now.

I'm not sure how long it will take to stand up the site because I know that I'll want to do it well and life is still busy. I wanted to document this moment though, and have a starting place for this project (even if it is just a markdown file).
