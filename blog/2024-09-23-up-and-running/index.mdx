I've gotten my personal website to a place that I'm happy with for now, although there are still a lot of things that I'd like to add to it.

{/* truncate */}

I was pretty sure that I wanted to use a React framework for the site because that's what I am most comfortable with. I also want to practice using React more! Despite this, I still looked around for inspiration. Here's some that I liked.

- [Artsy](https://artsy.github.io/) (Jekyll)
- [Evan Bacon](https://evanbacon.dev/) (Expo)
- [Betaflight](https://betaflight.com/) (Docusaurus)

I'm hoping to be able to use this as a playground for ideas in addition to writing so Jekyll didn't seem like the right solution. I also considered Remix and Next.js in addition to Expo but in the end I decided that Docusaurus was going to get me up and running quickly with plenty of room for flexibility. I've made an internal company documentation site with it before and I'm a big fan of the Betaflight site, so I went with it.

For now, I've decided to use GitHub Pages to deploy the site. It was super easy (and free!) to set up and does everything I need since the site is statically rendered. Docusaurus has a [great tutorial](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages) for setting up GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy. I also added PostHog (free tier) for analytics and learned a little bit about using secrets with GitHub Actions.

I've done a lot of work with mobile apps and I've been wanting to experiment with Progressive Web Apps for a while. There's a great Docusaurus [plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-pwa) for PWA's so I got that hooked up and it's working well!

Thanks to [Evan Tay](https://evantay.com/) for some inspiration for the landing page - he seems like a cool guy!

I have a bunch of other stuff that I'd like to add at some point so I'll jot those down now.

- Career Timeline
- Social Links
- Project Showcase
- Landing page visuals
- Custom Navbar
- Easy way to write these posts on my phone
- Blog folders?
- Blog images

These all seem like fun ideas but I might try to work some more on my [PSBC](https://github.com/ws998116/psbc) project here soon.
